# EdgeYoloSamPipeline
Edge-optimized computer vision project focused on real-time object detection and fine-grained segmentation using a hybrid YOLO + lightweight SAM-style architecture. The system integrates quantization, structured pruning, and knowledge distillation to aggressively reduce model size, memory footprint, and inference latency, enabling high-accuracy performance on resource-constrained edge hardware. The project emphasizes deployability through INT8/FP16 inference, channel- and layer-level pruning, and teacher–student training pipelines, producing production-grade compressed models for low-power, real-time visual understanding tasks.
